Death Is Not an Escape.Dead by Daylight is a multiplayer (4vs1) horror game where one player takes on the role of the savage Killer, and the other four players play as Survivors, trying to escape the Killer and avoid being caught, tortured and killed. Survivors play in third-person and have the advantage of better situational awareness. The Killer plays in first-person and is more focused on their prey. The Survivors' goal in each encounter is to escape the Killing Ground without getting caught by the Killer - something that sounds easier than it is, especially when the environment changes every time you play.Key Features•	Survive Together… Or Not - Survivors can either cooperate with the others or be selfish. Your chance of survival will vary depending on whether you work together as a team or if you go at it alone. Will you be able to outwit the Killer and escape their Killing Ground?•	Where Am I? - Each level is procedurally generated, so you’ll never know what to expect. Random spawn points mean you will never feel safe as the world and its danger change every time you play.•	A Feast for Killers - Dead by Daylight draws from all corners of the horror world. As a Killer you can play as anything from a powerful Slasher to terrifying paranormal entities. Familiarize yourself with your Killing Grounds and master each Killer’s unique power to be able to hunt, catch and sacrifice your victims.•	Deeper and Deeper - Each Killer and Survivor has their own deep progression system and plenty of unlockables that can be customized to fit your own personal strategy. Experience, skills and understanding of the environment are key to being able to hunt or outwit the Killer.•	Real People, Real Fear - The procedural levels and real human reactions to pure horror makes each game session an unexpected scenario. You will never be able to tell how it’s going to turn out. Ambience, music, and chilling environments combine into a terrifying experience. With enough time, you might even discover what’s hiding in the fog.WARNING: PHOTOSENSITIVITY/EPILEPSY SEIZURES - READ THIS NOTICE BEFORE PLAYINGA very small percentage of people may experience epileptic seizures or blackouts when exposed to certain kinds of flashing lights or light patterns.

Portal 2,"The ""Perpetual Testing Initiative"" has been expanded to allow you to design co-op puzzles for you and your friends!","About This Game
							Portal 2 draws from the award-winning formula of innovative gameplay, story, and music that earned the original Portal over 70 industry accolades and created a cult following.										The single-player portion of Portal 2 introduces a cast of dynamic new characters, a host of fresh puzzle elements, and a much larger set of devious test chambers. Players will explore never-before-seen areas of the Aperture Science Labs and be reunited with GLaDOS, the occasionally murderous computer companion who guided them through the original game. 										The game’s two-player cooperative mode features its own entirely separate campaign with a unique story, test chambers, and two new player characters. This new mode forces players to reconsider everything they thought they knew about portals. Success will require them to not just act cooperatively, but to think cooperatively.  Product Features Extensive single player: Featuring next generation gameplay and a wildly-engrossing story. Complete two-person co-op: Multiplayer game featuring its own dedicated story, characters, and gameplay. Advanced physics: Allows for the creation of a whole new range of interesting challenges, producing a much larger but not harder game. Original music. Massive sequel: The original Portal was named 2007's Game of the Year by over 30 publications worldwide.

PAYDAY 2,"PAYDAY 2 is an action-packed, four-player co-op shooter that once again lets gamers don the masks of the original PAYDAY crew - Dallas, Hoxton, Wolf and Chains - as they descend on Washington DC for an epic crime spree.","About This Game
							PAYDAY 2 is an action-packed, four-player co-op shooter that once again lets gamers don the masks of the original PAYDAY crew - Dallas, Hoxton, Wolf and Chains - as they descend on Washington DC for an epic crime spree. The CRIMENET network offers a huge range of dynamic contracts, and players are free to choose anything from small-time convenience store hits or kidnappings, to big league cyber-crime or emptying out major bank vaults for that epic PAYDAY. While in DC, why not participate in the local community, and run a few political errands?Up to four friends co-operate on the hits, and as the crew progresses the jobs become bigger, better and more rewarding. Along with earning more money and becoming a legendary criminal comes a character customization and crafting system that lets crews build and customize their own guns and gear.Key FeaturesRob Banks, Get Paid – Players must choose their crew carefully, because when the job goes down they will need the right mix of skills on their side.CRIMENET – The dynamic contract database lets gamers pick and choose from available jobs by connecting with local contacts such as Vlad the Ukrainian, shady politician ""The Elephant"", and South American drug trafficker Hector, all with their own agenda and best interests in mind.PAYDAY Gunplay and Mechanics on a New Level – Firing weapons and zip tying civilians never felt so good.Dynamic Scenarios – No heist ever plays out the same way twice. Every single scenario has random geometry or even rare events.Choose Your Skills – As players progress they can invest in any of five special Skill Trees: Mastermind, Enforcer, Ghost, Technician and Fugitive. Each features a deep customization tree of associated skills and equipment to master, and they can be mixed and matched to create the ultimate heister.More Masks than Ever – PAYDAY 2 features a completely new mask system, giving players the ability to craft their own unique mask with a pattern and color of their choice, resulting in millions of different combinations.  Weapons and Modifications – A brand new arsenal for the serious heister, covering everything from sniper and assault rifles to compact PDWs and SMGs. Once you've settled for a favorite, you can modify it with optics, suppressors, fore grips, reticles, barrels, frames, stocks and more, all of which will affect the performance of your weapon. There are also purely aesthetic enhancements - why not go for the drug lord look with polished walnut grips for your nine?Play It Your Way – Each job allows for multiple approaches, such as slow and stealthy ambushes or running in guns blazing. Hit the target any way you want, each approach will provide a different experience.A Long History of Additional Content – More than 70 updates since release, including new heists, characters, weapons and other gameplay features like driving cars and forklifts.","['Co-op', 'Action', 'FPS', 'Heist', 'Multiplayer', 'Looter Shooter', 'Online Co-Op', 'Stealth', 'Crime', 'Shooter', 'Team-Based', 'First-Person', 'Great Soundtrack', 'Gun Customization', 'Tactical', 'PvE', 'Strategy', 'Singleplayer', 'Funny', 'Simulation']","['OS *: Windows 7', 'Processor: 2 GHz Intel Dual Core Processor', 'Memory: 4 GB RAM', 'Graphics: Nvidia & AMD (512MB VRAM)', 'DirectX: Version 9.0c', 'Storage: 83 GB available space', 'VR Support: SteamVR.

ARK: Survival Evolved,"Stranded on the shores of a mysterious island, you must learn to survive. Use your cunning to kill or tame the primeval creatures roaming the land, and encounter other players to survive, dominate... and escape!","About This Game
							As a man or woman stranded naked, freezing and starving on the shores of a mysterious island called ARK, you must hunt, harvest resources, craft items, grow crops, research technologies, and build shelters to withstand the elements. Use your cunning and resources to kill or tame & breed the leviathan dinosaurs and other primeval creatures roaming the land, and team up with or prey on hundreds of other players to survive, dominate... and escape!Dinosaurs, Creatures, & Breeding! -- over 100+ creatures can be tamed using a challenging capture-&-affinity process, involving weakening a feral creature to knock it unconscious, and then nursing it back to health with appropriate food. Once tamed, you can issue commands to your tames, which it may follow depending on how well you’ve tamed and trained it. Tames, which can continue to level-up and consume food, can also carry Inventory and Equipment such as Armor, carry prey back to your settlement depending on their strength, and larger tames can be ridden and directly controlled! Fly a Pterodactyl over the snow-capped mountains, lift allies over enemy walls, race through the jungle with a pack of Raptors, tromp through an enemy base along a gigantic brontosaurus, or chase down prey on the back of a raging T-Rex! Take part in a dynamic ecosystem life-cycle with its own predator & prey hierarchies, where you are just one creature among many species struggling for dominance and survival. Tames can also be mated with the opposite gender, to selectively breed successive generations using a trait system based on recombinant genetic inheritance. This process includes both egg-based incubation and mammalian gestation lifecycles! Or put more simply, raise babies!You must eat and drink to survive, with different kinds of plants & meat having different nutritional properties, including human meat. Ensuring a supply of fresh water to your home and inventory is a pressing concern. All physical actions come at a cost of food and water, long-distance travel is fraught with subsistence peril! Inventory weight makes you move slower, and the day/night cycle along with randomized weather patterns add another layer of challenge by altering the temperature of the environment, causing you to hunger or thirst more quickly. Build a fire or shelter, and craft a large variety of customizable clothing & armors, to help protect yourself against locational damage & extreme temperatures using the dynamic indoor/outdoor insulation calculation system! By chopping down forests full of trees and mining metal and other precious resources, you can craft the parts to build massive multi-leveled structures composed of complex snap-linked parts, including ramps, beams, pillars, windows, doors, gates, remote gates, trapdoors, water pipes, faucets, generators, wires and all manner of electrical devices, and ladders among many other types. Structures have a load system to fall apart if enough support has been destroyed, so reinforcing your buildings is important. All structures and items can be painted to customize the look of your home, as well as placing dynamically per-pixel paintable signs, textual billboards, and other decorative objects. Shelter reduces the extremes of weather and provides security for yourself and your stash! Weapons, clothing & armor gear can also be painted to express your own visual style.Pick seeds from the wild vegetation around you, plant them in plots that you lay down, water them and nurture them with fertilizer (everything poops after consuming calories, which can then be composted, and some fertilizer is better than others). Tend to your crops and they will grow to produce delicious and rare fruits, which can also be used to cook a plethora of logical recipes and make useful tonics! Explore to find the rarest of plant seeds that have the most powerful properties! Vegetarians & vegans can flourish, and it will be possible to master and conquer the ARK in a non-violent manner!By bringing sufficient rare sacrificial items to special Summon locations, you can capture the attention of the one of the ARK’s god-like mythical creatures, who will arrive for battle. These gargantuan monstrosities provide an end-game goal for the most experienced groups of players and their armies of tames, and will yield extremely valuable progression items if they are defeated.Create a Tribe and add your friends to it, and all your tames can be commanded by and allied to anyone in your Tribe. Your Tribe will also be able to respawn at any of your home spawn points. Promote members to Tribe Admins to reduce the burden of management. Distribute key items and pass-codes to provide access your shared village!All items are crafted from Blueprints that have variable statistics and qualities, and require corresponding resources. More remote and harsh locales across the ARK tend to have better resources, including the tallest mountains, darkest caves, and depths of the ocean! Level-Up your player character by gaining experience through performance actions, Level-Up your tames, and learn new ""Engrams"" to be able to craft Items from memory without the use of blueprints, even if you die! Customize the underlying physical look of your character with hair, eye, and skin tones, along with an array of body proportion modifiers. As you explore the vast ARK, you'll find clues left by other Survivors who have made the ARK their home in ages past, in the form of collectible detailed 3D ""Explorer Notes"". By uncovering all of these, you can begin to piece together the true nature of the ARK, and discover its purpose!Everything you craft has durability and will wear-out from extended use if not repaired, and when you leave the game, your character remains sleeping in the persistent world. Your inventory physically exists in boxes or on your character in the world. Everything can be looted & stolen, so to achieve security you must build-up, team-up, or have tames to guard your stash. Death is permanent, and you can even knock out, capture, and force-feed other players to use them for your own purposes, such as extracting their blood to for transfusions, harvesting their fecal matter to use as fertilizer, or using them as food for your carnivorous tames!The mysterious ARK is a formidable and imposing environment, composed of many natural and unnatural structures, above-ground, below-ground, and underwater. By fully exploring its secrets, you’ll find the most exotic procedurally randomized creatures and rare blueprints. Also to be found are Explorer Notes that are dynamically updated into the game, written by previous human denizens of the ARK from across the millennia, creatively detailing the creatures and backstory of the ARK and its creatures. Fully develop your in-game ARK-map through exploration, write custom points of interest onto it, and craft a Compass or GPS coordinates to aid exploring with other players, whom you can communicate with via proximity text & voice chat, or long-distance radio. Construct & draw in-game signs for other players to help them or lead them astray...  And yet.. how do you ultimately challenge the Creators and Conquer the ARK? A definitive end-game is planned.On the 100+ player servers, your character, everything you built, and your tames, stay in-game even when you leave. You can even physically travel your character and items between the network of ARK's by accessing the Obelisks and uploading (or downloading) your data from the Steam Economy! A galaxy of ARKs, each slightly different than the previous, to leave your mark on and conquer, one at a time -- special official ARKs will be unveiled on the World-map for limited times in singular themed events with corresponding limited-run items! Furthermore, you can now design or randomize your own unique 'Procedurally Generated ARKs', for infinite replayability and endless surprises.You can play single-player local games, and bring your character and items between unofficial player-hosted servers, back and forth from singleplayer to multiplayer. Mod the game, with full Steam Workshop support and customized Unreal Engine 4 editor. See how we built our ARK using our maps and assets as an example. Host your own server and configure your ARK precisely to your liking. We want to see what you create!The over-the-top hyper real imagery of the ARK its creatures is brought to expressive life using a highly-customized Unreal Engine 4, with fully dynamic lighting & global illumination, weather systems (rain, fog, snow, etc) & true-to-life volumetric cloud simulation, and the latest in advanced DirectX11 and DirectX12 rendering techniques.

							1998. HALF-LIFE sends a shock through the game industry with its combination of pounding action and continuous, immersive storytelling. Valve's debut title wins more than 50 game-of-the-year awards on its way to being named ""Best PC Game Ever"" by PC Gamer, and launches a franchise with more than eight million retail units sold worldwide.		NOW. By taking the suspense, challenge and visceral charge of the original, and adding startling new realism and responsiveness, Half-Life 2 opens the door to a world where the player's presence affects everything around them, from the physical environment to the behaviors even the emotions of both friends and enemies.		The player again picks up the crowbar of research scientist Gordon Freeman, who finds himself on an alien-infested Earth being picked to the bone, its resources depleted, its populace dwindling. Freeman is thrust into the unenviable role of rescuing the world from the wrong he unleashed back at Black Mesa. And a lot of people he cares about are counting on him.		The intense, real-time gameplay of Half-Life 2 is made possible only by Source®, Valve's new proprietary engine technology. Source provides major enhancements in:  Characters: Advanced facial animation system delivers the most sophisticated in-game characters ever seen. With 40 distinct facial ""muscles,"" human characters convey the full array of human emotion, and respond to the player with fluidity and intelligence. Physics: From pebbles to water to 2-ton trucks respond as expected, as they obey the laws of mass, friction, gravity, and buoyancy.

UFO 50,"UFO 50 is a collection of 50 single and multiplayer games that span a variety of genres, from platformers and shoot 'em ups to puzzle games, roguelites, and RPGs. Our goal is to combine a familiar 8-bit aesthetic with new ideas and modern game design.","About This Game
UFO 50 is a collection of 50 single and multiplayer games from the creators of Spelunky, Downwell, and Catacomb Kids. Explore a variety of genres, from platformers and shoot 'em ups to puzzle games, roguelites, and RPGs. Our goal is to combine a familiar 8-bit aesthetic with new ideas and modern game design.50 BRAND NEW GAMES - These are NOT minigames or microgames! Although the size of each game varies, every one is a complete experience, from its opening title screen to its ending credits. Some are small arcade-style games but there are also larger open-world adventures and a JRPG that could take many hours to beat.AN ALTERNATE UNIVERSE - According to the story of UFO 50, the games were all created by a fictional 80s video game company that was obscure but ahead of its time. Some games are sequels to other games in the collection and various characters appear in multiple titles as part of a shared continuity.AN INSTANT LIBRARY - All 50 games are available to play at the start! The concept was inspired by multicarts, retro collections, and the experience of going to a friend's house and perusing their game library. Jump in and out of games at a whim - exploring the collection is part of the fun!AUTHENTIC BUT ALSO MODERN - We carefully chose what elements to modernize. Every game shares a unique 32-color palette and we took great efforts to make them look and sound like actual 8-bit titles from the 80s. On the other hand, it was important to us that UFO 50 was fun and surprising for modern players, so we chose not to limit ourselves to the genres and design conventions of the past.VERSUS AND CO-OP PLAY - Half of the collection features local multiplayer, including co-op and versus. You can compete head-to-head in a new fighting or strategy game... or team up to beat a classic arcade game from an alternate timeline. It's great for groups!Here are some of games you'll get to play in UFO 50:CAMPANELLA 2 - The sequel to Campanella (another game in UFO 50), Campanella 2 features procedurally-generated levels where you can explore in your UFO but also hop out to enter shops and dangerous caves. You play as the intrepid treasure-hunter Isabell, but she hasn't always been a hero - by playing the entire collection you can learn more about her past.QUIBBLE RACE - In this unique sci-fi ""horse-racing"" game, the goal is to win more money than your opponents, but why stop at betting? Thanks to the seedy alien underworld, you can hire thugs to tamper with the race or even sponsor your own quibble to earn extra credits. But your opponents can do the same, so the question is... how well can you anticipate their actions? Up to 3 players can compete in this turn-based game of betting and bluffing.PINGOLF - A fan favorite at gaming get-togethers like PAX, Pingolf is another fun multiplayer game that mixes golf with pinball. As you navigate 18 holes filled with bumpers, trampolines, and other crazy obstacles, a dot matrix display will light up at the bottom of the screen to cheer you on!SEASIDE DRIVE - Sometimes you'll want a break from long, open-world games and challenging strategy titles, so why not jump into a straight-forward arcade-style action game like Seaside Drive? But even in a popular genre, UFO 50 brings something new to the table - in this case, Ojiro Fumoto (the creator of Downwell) designed a stylish car-based shoot 'em up where ""drifting"" across the screen is how you power-up your gun.GRIMSTONE - Yes, there is a full blown JRPG in the collection! Grimstone follows many conventions from 8-bit console RPGs, but is streamlined for a modern audience. Also, to make combat more engaging, we added a skill-based component to battles and encounters on the overworld can be strategically avoided. The story takes place in the American Wild West, where somehow the land has been swallowed up by Hell! Creating your party from the ashes of a burned-down saloon, you'll be looking for answers as to why it happened.And that's just five games! Out of 50! So come join us and enjoy this collection of 8-bit classics from another dimension! There's something for everyone!","['Indie', 'Action', 'Pixel Graphics', 'Retro', 'Strategy', 'Adventure', 'RPG', '2D', 'Casual', 'Arcade']","['Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system', 'OS: Windows 10 64-bit', 'Processor: Intel Core i3-3220 CPU @ 3.30GHz', 'Memory: 8 GB RAM', 'Graphics: Intel HD Graphics', 'DirectX: Version 11', 'Storage: 500 MB available space', 'Additional Notes: Made with GameMaker']",['Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system'],"18 Sep, 2024",['Mossmouth'],['Mossmouth'],Very Positive,(94% of 843) All Time,809,https://store.steampowered.com/app/1147860/UFO_50?snr=1_category_4_adventure_salebrowseall

Lethal Company,A co-op horror about scavenging at abandoned moons to sell scrap to the Company.,"About This Game
You are a contracted worker for the Company. Your job is to collect scrap from abandoned, industrialized moons to meet the Company's profit quota. You can use the cash you earn to travel to new moons with higher risks and rewards--or you can buy fancy suits and decorations for your ship. Experience nature, scanning any creature you find to add them to your bestiary. Explore the wondrous outdoors and rummage through their derelict, steel and concrete underbellies. Just never miss the quota. These dangers prey upon the vulnerable and lonesome, and the protection of your crew may be your only hope. You can guide your crewmates from your ship, using the radar to call out traps and using the ship's terminal to access remotely locked doors--or you can all go in together. The Company store has many useful tools for the job, including lights, shovels, walkie talkies, stun grenades, or boomboxes. Things get dangerous at night. Communicate with your crewmates to carry all valuables to the ship before things get too dangerous, and try not to leave anyone behind.","['Online Co-Op', 'Horror', 'First-Person', 'Co-op', 'Survival Horror', 'Exploration', 'Psychological Horror', 'Funny', 'Sci-fi', 'PvE', 'Atmospheric', 'Procedural Generation', 'Aliens', 'Time Management', 'Adventure', 'Dungeon Crawler', 'Action', 'Early Access', 'Action-Adventure', 'Perma Death']","['Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system', 'OS: Windows 10', 'Processor: Intel Core i5-7400 CPU @ 3.00GHz ; Shader Model 5', 'Graphics: NVIDIA GForce GTX 1050', 'DirectX: Version 11', 'Network: Broadband Internet connection', 'Storage: 2 GB available space']",['Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system'],"23 Oct, 2023",['Zeekerss'],['Zeekerss'],Overwhelmingly Positive,"(349,667)","302,108",https://store.steampowered.com/app/1966720/Lethal_Company?snr=1_category_4_adventure_salebrowseall

							Respawn into a new dinosaur survival experience beyond your wildest dreams… as ARK is reimagined from the ground-up into the next-generation of videogame technology with Unreal Engine 5! You awake on a mysterious island, your senses overwhelmed by the blinding sunlight and brilliant colors bouncing off every surface around you, the azure waters of a verdant Island lapping at your bare feet. A deep roar echoes from the misty jungle, jolting you into action, and you stand up – not afraid, but intrigued. Are you ready to form a tribe, tame and breed hundreds of species of dinosaurs and other primeval creatures, explore, craft, build, and fight your way to the top of the food-chain? Your new world awaits… step through the looking-glass and join it!FEATURESARK: Survival Ascended has completely recreated and redesigned the artwork and worlds of ARK to take advantage of the latest in videogame technology, Unreal Engine 5, using high-end graphics features such as fully dynamic Global Illumination (“Lumen”), so that light bounces realistically off of surfaces and provides realistic reflections, and advanced mesh streaming (“Nanite”) of hundreds of millions of triangles for extreme detail.Advanced new physics systems such as dynamic water so that every creature creates waves, ripples, splashes, and bubbles as they move through fluids, and fully interactive physical foliage where every blade of grass, bush, and tree reacts to characters, explosions, projectiles, and physics objects. Knock down a tree, and see it crash into other trees and disturb all the foliage on its way down to smacking into the grass below! Detect an enemy moving sneakily through the grass as it shifts and sways in response to their presence. Demolish a building and watch the pieces break apart realistically, interacting with the grass and water as they fall.ARK: Survival Ascended includes access to all of ARK’s worlds, including Scorched Earth, Aberration, Extinction, ARK Genesis Part 1, ARK Genesis Part 2, and more. The Island, Scorched Earth, Aberration and The Center are released now, with the subsequent expansion worlds to be added at no additional cost on a regular basis.The definitive survival experience returns better than ever: design your Survivor, form a tribe, and tame, train, breed & ride dinosaurs within a living ecosystem.

Crusader Kings III,"Love, fight, scheme, and claim greatness. Determine your noble house’s legacy in the sprawling grand strategy of Crusader Kings III. Death is only the beginning as you guide your dynasty’s bloodline in the rich and larger-than-life simulation of the Middle Ages.","About This Game
							Your legacy awaits. Choose your noble house and lead your dynasty to greatness in a Middle Ages epic that spans generations. War is but one of many tools to establish your reign, as real strategy requires expert diplomatic skill, mastery of your realm, and true cunning. Crusader Kings III continues the popular series made by Paradox Development Studio, featuring the widely acclaimed marriage of immersive grand strategy and deep, dramatic medieval roleplaying.   Take command of your house and expand your dynasty through a meticulously researched Middle Ages. Begin in 867 or 1066 and claim lands, titles, and vassals to secure a realm worthy of your royal blood. Your death is only a footnote as your lineage continues with new playable heirs, either planned… or not.  Discover a sprawling simulated world teeming with peasants and knights, courtiers, spies, knaves and jesters, and secret love affairs. An extensive cast of historical characters can be romanced, betrayed, executed, or subtly influenced.   Explore a vast medieval map stretching from the snowswept Nordic lands to the Horn of Africa, and the British Isles in the west to the exotic riches of Burma in the east. Claim, conquer, and rule thousands of unique counties, duchies, kingdoms, and empires.  Each character is larger than life, with traits and lifestyle choices determining their actions and schemes. Prompt fear and dread as you rule with an iron fist, or inspire your subjects with magnanimous deeds. Genetics can be passed along to your children, be it the gift of genius or crippling stupidity.  Groom your heir with the appropriate guardians or educate them yourself. If found wanting, marry them off or despatch them through other means.  Customize your ruler and noble house, from appearance to attributes, and create a monarch worthy of all their inherited virtues and vices. Govern an ever-evolving realm and grant titles to whom you see fit - or usurp your liege to claim their crown as your own. Be wary of rivals, from restless serfs to revengeful concubines.  The shadows stir frequently, and danger lurks around every darkened corner. Recruit agents and other unsavory elements to undermine, blackmail, or murder those who stand in your path. Or be inspired by the bard and ballad, and seduce your way to power and influence. Blood will flow. Assemble men-at-arms units and powerful knights. Manage your battlefield tactics and armies. Raid and plunder nearby lands or hire mercenaries and Holy Orders for your major conflicts.  Be a pious king to invite the religious powers to your side, or design your own faith as you battle between everlasting fame or eternal damnation. Bring novel innovations to your culture and construct mighty castles and bastions to increase the wealth, prestige, and security of your realm.  The paths to follow are limitless: experience thousands of dynamic events and life-altering decisions tailored to each and every conceivable situation and character. There are countless ways of securing and keeping your place in the history books.","['Strategy', 'Medieval', 'Grand Strategy', 'Simulation', 'RPG', 'Historical', 'Management', 'Character Customization', 'RTS', 'Life Sim', 'Sandbox', 'Choices Matter', 'War', 'Singleplayer', 'Economy', '4X', 'Political', 'Moddable', 'Multiplayer', 'Real-Time with Pause']","['Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system', 'OS: Windows® 10 Home 64 bit', 'Processor: Intel® Core™ i3-2120 / AMD® FX 6350', 'Memory: 6 GB RAM', 'Graphics: Nvidia® GeForce™ GTX 660 (2GB) / AMD® Radeon™ HD 7870 (2GB) / Intel® Iris Pro™ 580 / Intel® Iris® Plus G7 / AMD® Radeon™ Vega 11', 'Storage: 8 GB available space']","['Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system', 'OS: Windows® 10 Home 64 bit', 'Processor: Intel® Core™ i5-4670K / AMD® Ryzen™ 5 2400G', 'Memory: 8 GB RAM', 'Graphics: Nvidia® GeForce™ GTX 1650 (4GB) / AMD® Radeon™ R9 390X (8GB)', 'Storage: 8 GB available space']","1 Sep, 2020",['Paradox Development Studio'],['Paradox Interactive'],Very Positive,"(72,759)","54,773",https://store.steampowered.com/app/1158310/Crusader_Kings_III?snr=1_category_4_rpg_salebrowseall

Kenshi,"A free-roaming squad based RPG. Focusing on open-ended sandbox gameplay features rather than a linear story. Be a trader, a thief, a rebel, a warlord, an adventurer, a farmer, a slave, or just food for the cannibals. Train your men up from puny victims to master warriors.","About This Game
							A free-roaming squad based RPG focusing on open-ended sandbox gameplay features rather than a linear story. Be a trader, a thief, a rebel, a warlord, an adventurer, a farmer, a slave, or just food for the cannibals. Research new equipment and craft new gear. Purchase and upgrade your own buildings to use as safe fortified havens when things go bad, or use them to start up a business. Aid or oppose the various factions in the world while striving for the strength and wealth necessary to simply survive in the harsh desert. Train your men up from puny victims to master warriors. Carry your wounded squad mates to safety and get them all home alive.FEATURESFreeform gameplay in a seamless game world in the largest single-player RPG world since Daggerfall, stretching over 870 square kilometers. The game will never seek to limit you or restrict your personal play style. Custom design as many characters as you want and build up a whole squad to fight for you. Characters will grow and become stronger with experience, not just in their stats but their appearance too. Build a base where you can research new technologies, upgrade your defences and craft new gear. Original take on the RTS-RPG hybrid genre. No ""hero"" characters with artificially stronger stats than everybody else- Every character and NPC you meet is potentially an equal, and has a name, a life. You are not the chosen one. You're not great and powerful. You don't have more 'hitpoints' than everyone else. You are not the center of the universe, and you are not special. Unless you work for it.Purchase and upgrade your own buildings to use as safe fortified havens when things go bad, or use them to start up a business. Variation and possibilities of gameplay. Be good, be evil, be a businessman, be a thief, live in a town, live in the desert, travel alone, travel in hordes, build a fortress, raze a city. Devote yourself to freeing slaves, or maybe end up a slave yourself. Dynamic, ever changing world. Support or hinder whoever you wish, or keep to yourself, the world won't stop moving. This is not just a ""game"", you are living and surviving in a simulated world.Get captured by cannibals and eaten alive, or sold off by slavers and forced to work in the mines. These are not scripted events, just a regular part of this chaotic world that ruins your life by chance. Anything can happen, yet anything can be overcome if you have the strength. Absolutely no Level-scaling. The world does not level up along with you, and the shops don't change their inventory to only items matching your level. At the start of the game almost everyone will be stronger than you, and survival will always be a struggle. The game won't hold your hand or help you when you're down. Realistic medical system that affects gameplay. A character with a wounded leg will limp or crawl and slow the party down, wounded arms means you must use your sword one-handed or not at all. Severe injuries will result in amputees needing robotic limb replacements. Blood loss means you can pass out, and the blood will attract predators. A character’s stats are affected by equipment, encumbrance, blood loss, injuries and starvation. Intelligent AI that allows for characters to reason and work towards long-term goals and desires. Squads work together and carry their wounded to safety. Characters can be setup to take care of micromanagement for you and run production in your base. Aid or oppose the various factions in the world while striving for the strength and wealth necessary to simply survive in the harsh environment. Independently developed with no design influences, or alterations dictated by men in gray suits who have never played a game before in their lives. Original game world. There are no fantasy-knock-off cliches. No magic.","['Open World', 'Sandbox', 'RPG', 'Survival', 'Strategy', 'Building', 'Base Building', 'Singleplayer', 'Post-apocalyptic', 'Crafting', 'City Builder', 'Indie', 'Simulation', 'Adventure', 'Management', 'RTS', 'Character Customization', 'Ninja', 'Alternate History', 'Steampunk']","['OS:64-bit Windows', 'Processor:Dual-core 64-bit', 'Memory:6 GB RAM', 'Graphics:Pixel shader 5.0 capable card', 'DirectX®:11', 'Hard Drive:14GB HD space']","['OS *:Windows 7 64-bit', 'Processor:Quad-core 64-bit', 'Memory:16 GB RAM', 'DirectX®:11', 'Hard Drive:14GB HD space']","6 Dec, 2018",['Lo-Fi Games'],['Lo-Fi Games'],Overwhelmingly Positive,"(74,177)","45,382",https://store.steampowered.com/app/233860/Kenshi?snr=1_category_4_rpg_100727

Rather than typical academic fare, students in Two Point County enjoy a range of wild and wonderful courses: from Knight School (hey, we all have to learn jousting at some point in our lives), to the salivatory Gastronomy, where your students will build mouth-watering concoctions like giant pizzas and enormous pies. The academic year… is here!Take advantage of the opportunity to spend way more time with the little people in your university.

RimWorld,"A sci-fi colony sim driven by an intelligent AI storyteller. Generates stories by simulating psychology, ecology, gunplay, melee combat, climate, biomes, diplomacy, interpersonal relationships, art, medicine, trade, and more.","About This Game
RimWorld is a sci-fi colony sim driven by an intelligent AI storyteller. Inspired by Dwarf Fortress, Firefly, and Dune.You begin with three survivors of a shipwreck on a distant world.Manage colonists' moods, needs, wounds, illnesses and addictions.Build in the forest, desert, jungle, tundra, and more.Watch colonists develop and break relationships with family members, lovers, and spouses.Replace wounded limbs and organs with prosthetics, bionics, or biological parts harvested from others.Fight pirates, tribes, mad animals, giant insects and ancient killing machines.Craft structures, weapons, and apparel from metal, wood, stone, cloth, and futuristic materials.Tame and train cute pets, productive farm animals, and deadly attack beasts.Trade with passing ships and caravans.Form caravans to complete quests, trade, attack other factions, or migrate your whole colony.Dig through snow, weather storms, and fight fires.Capture refugees or prisoners and turn them to your side or sell them into slavery.Discover a new generated world each time you play.Explore hundreds of wild and interesting mods on the Steam Workshop.Learn to play easily with the help of an intelligent and unobtrusive AI tutor.RimWorld is a story generator. It’s designed to co-author tragic, twisted, and triumphant stories about imprisoned pirates, desperate colonists, starvation and survival. It works by controlling the “random” events that the world throws at you. Every thunderstorm, pirate raid, and traveling salesman is a card dealt into your story by the AI Storyteller. There are several storytellers to choose from. Randy Random does crazy stuff, Cassandra Classic goes for rising tension, and Phoebe Chillax likes to relax.Your colonists are not professional settlers – they’re crash-landed survivors from a passenger liner destroyed in orbit. You can end up with a nobleman, an accountant, and a housewife. You’ll acquire more colonists by capturing them in combat and turning them to your side, buying them from slave traders, or taking in refugees. So your colony will always be a motley crew.Each person’s background is tracked and affects how they play. A nobleman will be great at social skills (recruiting prisoners, negotiating trade prices), but refuse to do physical work. A farm oaf knows how to grow food by long experience, but cannot do research. A nerdy scientist is great at research, but cannot do social tasks at all. A genetically engineered assassin can do nothing but kill – but he does that very well.Colonists develop - and destroy - relationships. Each has an opinion of the others, which determines whether they'll become lovers, marry, cheat, or fight. Perhaps your two best colonists are happily married - until one of them falls for the dashing surgeon who saved her from a gunshot wound.The game generates a whole planet from pole to equator. You choose whether to land your crash pods in a cold northern tundra, a parched desert flat, a temperate forest, or a steaming equatorial jungle. Different areas have different animals, plants, diseases, temperatures, rainfall, mineral resources, and terrain. These challenges of surviving in a disease-infested, choking jungle are very different from those in a parched desert wasteland or a frozen tundra with a two-month growing season.Travel across the planet. You're not stuck in one place. You can form a caravan of people, animals, and prisoners. Rescue kidnapped former allies from pirate outposts, attend peace talks, trade with other factions, attack enemy colonies, and complete other quests. You can even pack up your entire colony and move to a new place. You can use rocket-powered transport pods to travel faster.You can tame and train animals. Lovable pets will cheer up sad colonists. Farm animals can be worked, milked, and sheared. Attack beasts can be released upon your enemies. There are many animals - cats, labrador retrievers, grizzly bears, camels, cougars, chinchillas, chickens, and exotic alien-like lifeforms.People in RimWorld constantly observe their situation and surroundings in order to decide how to feel at any given moment. They respond to hunger and fatigue, witnessing death, disrespectfully unburied corpses, being wounded, being left in darkness, getting packed into cramped environments, sleeping outside or in the same room as others, and many other situations. If they're too stressed, they might lash out or break down.Wounds, infections, prosthetics, and chronic conditions are tracked on each body part and affect characters' capacities. Eye injuries make it hard to shoot or do surgery. Wounded legs slow people down. Hands, brain, mouth, heart, liver, kidneys, stomach, feet, fingers, toes, and more can all be wounded, diseased, or missing, and all have logical in-game effects. And other species have their own body layouts - take off a deer's leg, and it can still hobble on the other three. Take off a rhino's horn, and it's much less dangerous.You can repair body parts with prosthetics ranging from primitive to transcendent. A peg leg will get Joe Colonist walking after an unfortunate incident with a rhinoceros, but he'll still be quite slow. Buy an expensive bionic leg from a trader the next year, and Joe becomes a superhuman runner. You can even extract, sell, buy, and transplant internal organs.And there's much more than that! The game is easy to mod and has an active mod community.

Dyson Sphere Program,"Build the most efficient intergalactic factory in space simulation strategy game Dyson Sphere Program! Harness the power of stars, collect resources, plan and design production lines and develop your interstellar factory from a small space workshop to a galaxy-wide industrial empire.","About This Game
Dyson Sphere Program is a sci-fi sandbox construction game with space, adventure, exploration and factory automation elements. In the future, humanity creates a supercomputer known as the ""CentreBrain"" with the hope of utilizing its powerful computing capabilities to further expand the application of virtual worlds.You are a space engineer in charge of a project launched by the space alliance COSMO, tasked with a massive undertaking: constructing Dyson Spheres (a megastructure that would orbit around a star, harnessing all its power and energy) to produce the energy that CentreBrain needs.Each game features a unique and one-of-a-kind universeStart with a small workshop and improve it until it spans the whole galaxyEngage in battles, construct defensive structures to repel enemy attacksExplore a vast universe with various celestial bodies, including neutron stars, white dwarfs, red giants, and even black holesAutomate production beyond planetary surfaces, transporting resources across star systemsDevelop your very own Dyson SpheresPerfectly show the constructions you've completed on a planet's surfaceBlueprint allows you to save important plansCustomize the mecha to create unique designs and traverse the universe with your creationTo construct a Dyson Sphere, you need to utilize automation. Start simple and gradually increase complexity. Maximize the stable output of resources through automated facilities. Connect resources with conveyor belts, transporting raw materials to processing facilities, and then conveying the products to the next stage. Progress from basic transport lines to elaborate plans for factories with diverse outputs. Utilize your production to drive technological advancements, meeting the necessary conditions for building the Dyson Sphere.During the construction, buildings will automatically snap to the grid. When laying conveyor belts, the use of snapping allows for automatic alignment, significantly improving efficiency. This enables the creation of large-scale automated production lines. The construction of the Dyson Sphere relies on vast and efficient factories.The convenient blueprint technology allows you to save your essential plans. You can save factory designs as blueprints and deploy them directly in other locations, eliminating the hassle of repetitive operations.You can construct Dyson Shells on multiple orbits, and each layer of the Dyson Shell can be customized. Connect various nodes on the Dyson Shell, creating the patterns you desire. Each Dyson Sphere is a unique masterpiece crafted by you.Each planet will have unique mineral distribution and ecological characteristics. Every time you enter the game, you can experience a randomly generated and entirely new starmap, with landscapes and resource deposits changing accordingly.Each planet has its own orbit, experiencing the gravitational effects of its star with rotation and revolution, resulting in day and night changes influenced by the star. In addition, there are unique celestial bodies such as neutron stars, white dwarfs, red giants, and even black holes, awaiting your exploration in this vast universe.The resources on a single planet might be insufficient for such an extensive project. You can harness the abundant resources of other planets. Overcoming the constraints of surface transport, establish your interstellar transportation routes. Interconnect planets with fleets of transport ships, tapping into the unique resources of each planet to ensure an uninterrupted supply of raw materials for your factories.Not only can you paint Icarus in your favorite colors, but you can also customize every component, creating your vision of a futuristic light industrial mech.The Dark Fog has arrived, resenting countless challenges to your factory construction endeavors. In addition to pursuing the goal of building the Dyson Sphere, you must also focus on defending your factories in Rise of the Dark Fog. The Dark Fog will do everything possible to hinder the progress of the ""Dyson Sphere Program,"" with Icarus also being a target of their attacks. Be prepared!Don't rely solely on Icarus to face the overwhelming numbers of the Dark Fog. COSMO has devised contingency plans to assist you in repelling the attacks of the Dark Fog. While constructing factories, you'll need to deploy essential defense structures. The more active your operations, the more frequently the Dark Fog will launch fierce assaults. Utilize your defense facilities to unleash ""fireworks"" and disperse the Dark Fog.We are Youthcat Studio from Chongqing, China. Starting as a team of five, we have grown steadily (though not excessively) as we journey alongside Dyson Sphere Program. Driven by our love for science fiction, we've created this game—taking you from building the first mining machine to establishing automated factories across the cosmos.

This game is for people who enjoy throwing around ragdolls but want it to be more detailed, satisfying, and feel more free while doing so.Ragdolls are simple on the outside but detailed on the inside. You can siphon their blood and replace it with nitroglycerine. You can submerge their head and cause brain damage by asphyxiation. Think of something horrible, and you can probably do it in People Playground. Afterwards, you could even hook them up to an ECG and blood supply to try to get them back on their feet.Every object in the game has its own physical properties: weight, sharpness, thermal and electrical conductivity, ferromagnetism, heat capacity, bullet resistance, and so on. The game simulates temperature, heat transfer through objects and through the air, electricity, and rigid body dynamics. All these systems combined make for emergent gameplay. You may experience behaviour that was never explicitly implemented.Mutilation aside, you are encouraged to build interesting contraptions or download them from the Steam Workshop. Construct airplanes, walkers, impenetrable bases, automatic doors, shields, computers, unholy weaponry - it's up to you!Once you get bored of the limited amount of items, you may download one of many Workshop mods and addons to expand the toy box, or you could make your own.","['Sandbox', 'Gore', 'Physics', 'Blood', 'Moddable', 'Violent', '2D', 'Singleplayer', 'Destruction', 'Simulation', 'Funny', 'Building', 'Pixel Graphics', 'Psychological Horror', 'Indie', 'Action', 'Casual', 'Horror', 'Comedy', 'Choose Your Own Adventure']","['OS *: Windows 7 SP2+', 'Processor: 2 GHz', 'Memory: 4 GB RAM', 'Graphics: Graphics card with DX10 (shader model 4.0) capabilities', 'DirectX: Version 10', 'Storage: 350 MB available space']","['OS: Windows 10', 'Processor: 3 GHz', 'Memory: 8 GB RAM', 'Graphics: Graphics card with DX10 (shader model 4.0) capabilities', 'DirectX: Version 12', 'Storage: 1 GB available space', 'Additional Notes: This game offers enough freedom to be able to slow down any computer.

Cities: Skylines is a modern take on the classic city simulation. The game introduces new game play elements to realize the thrill and hardships of creating and maintaining a real city whilst expanding on some well-established tropes of the city building experience. You’re only limited by your imagination, so take control and reach for the sky!Multi-tiered and challenging simulationConstructing your city from the ground up is easy to learn, but hard to master. Playing as the mayor of your city you’ll be faced with balancing essential requirements such as education, water electricity, police, fire fighting, healthcare and much more along with your citys real economy system. Citizens within your city react fluidly, with gravitas and with an air of authenticity to a multitude of game play scenarios.Extensive local traffic simulationColossal Order's extensive experience developing the Cities in Motion series is fully utilized in a fully fleshed out and well-crafted local traffic simulation.Districts and PoliciesBe more than just an administrator from city hall. Designating parts of your city as a district results in the application of policies which results in you rising to the status of Mayor for your own city.Utilize the Day and Night CycleThe city changes during the hours of the day and affects citizen schedules. Traffic is visibly slower at night and some zoned areas do not work with full efficiency. Cities: Skylines will put you in control of managing the different aspects of the day and night cycles.Extensive modding supportBuild or improve on existing maps and structures. You can then import your creations into the game, share them as well as download the creations of other city builders on the Steam workshop.","['City Builder', 'Simulation', 'Building', 'Management', 'Strategy', 'Sandbox', 'Singleplayer', 'Moddable', 'Economy', 'Resource Management', 'Mod', 'Realistic', 'Replay Value', 'Casual', 'Modern', 'Real-Time with Pause', 'Family Friendly', 'Great Soundtrack', 'Funny', 'Action']","['Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system', 'OS: Windows® 10 Home 64 Bit', 'Processor: Intel® Core™ I7 930  |  AMD® FX 6350', 'Memory: 8 GB RAM', 'Graphics: Nvidia® GeForce™ GTS 450 (1 GB) |  AMD® R7 250 (2 GB)  |  Intel Iris Xe G7 (Tiger Lake)', 'DirectX: Version 9.0c', 'Network: Broadband Internet connection', 'Storage: 4 GB available space']","['Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system', 'OS: Windows® 10 Home 64 bit', 'Processor: Intel® Core™ I7 2700K  |   AMD® Ryzen 7 2700X', 'Memory: 16 GB RAM', 'Graphics: Nvidia® GeForce™ GTX 580 (1.5 GB)  |   AMD® Radeon™ RX 560 (4 GB)', 'DirectX: Version 11', 'Network: Broadband Internet connection', 'Storage: 4 GB available space']","10 Mar, 2015",['Colossal Order Ltd.'],['Paradox Interactive'],Very Positive,"(193,925)","118,310",https://store.steampowered.com/app/255710/Cities_Skylines?snr=1_category_4_simulation_100727

							In the space-colony simulation game Oxygen Not Included you’ll find that scarcities of oxygen, warmth and sustenance are constant threats to your colony's survival. Guide colonists through the perils of subterranean asteroid living and watch as their population grows until they're not simply surviving, but thriving... Just make sure you don't forget to breathe.Build Extensive Bases and Discover What it Takes to Survive:Everything in your space colony is under your control, from excavation and resource allocation right down to plumbing and power systems. Resources will begin depleting with your first breath, however, so be sure to dig fast if you want to live.It’s Mind Over Matter with Stress Simulations:Keep the psychological impact of survival at bay with fun leisure activities, great accommodations and even better food for your colony. Duplicants each have different and potentially destructive ways of reacting to stress, so be sure to always keep them happy.

Keep tabs on ambient environmental temperatures and your colony's heat production to maintain a nice, cozy atmosphere for your colonists.Enhance Efficiency through Complex Gas and Liquid Simulations:Create interlocking pipe systems to swiftly deliver fuel and liquid to critical areas of your base. Plan well and be rewarded as your colony transforms into an imperishable, well-oiled machine.Take Charge with Power Grid Simulations:Choose from a multitude of power sources including coal, hydrogen, natural gas or just plain old elbow grease.

Monitor carbon dioxide accumulation and oversee oxygen generation processes to mold your colony into a veritable deep-space oasis.Waste Nothing through Extreme Recycling:Make use of every last resource for a base that truly exemplifies efficiency. Recycle waste into precious fuel, process unbreathable gas into air or harness the natural bodily processes of wild creatures for food.

Total War: WARHAMMER II,"Strategy gaming perfected. A breath-taking campaign of exploration, expansion and conquest across a fantasy world. Turn-based civilisation management and real-time epic strategy battles with thousands of troops and monsters at your command.","About This Game
DEFEND YOUR WORLD. DESTROY THEIRS. Total War: WARHAMMER II is a strategy game of titanic proportions. Choose from four unique, varied factions and wage war your way – mounting a campaign of conquest to save or destroy a vast and vivid fantasy world.  This is a game of two halves – one a turn-based open-world campaign, and the other intense, tactical real-time battles across the fantastical landscapes of the New World.Play how you choose – delve into a deep engrossing campaign, experience unlimited replayability and challenge the world in multiplayer with a custom army of your favourite units. Total War: WARHAMMER II offers hundreds of hours of gameplay and no two games are the same. World-Spanning ConquestEngage in statecraft, diplomacy, exploration and build your empire, turn by turn. Capture, build and manage teeming settlements and recruit vast armies. Level up Legendary Lords and Heroes and arm them with mythical weapons and armour. Negotiate alliances or declare Total War to subjugate any that stand between you and your goal. Epic Real-Time BattlesCommand thousands-strong legions of soldiers in intense tactical battles. Send forth ferocious, twisted monsters, fire-breathing dragons and harness powerful magic. Utilise military strategies, lay ambushes, or use brute force to turn the tide of combat and lead your forces to victory.The second in a trilogy and sequel to the award-winning Total War: WARHAMMER, Total War: WARHAMMER II brings players a breath-taking new narrative campaign, set across the vast continents of Lustria, Ulthuan, Naggaroth and the Southlands. The Great Vortex Campaign builds pace to culminate in a definitive and climactic endgame, an experience unlike any other Total War title to date.Playing as one of 8 Legendary Lords across 4 iconic races from the world of Warhammer Fantasy Battles, players must succeed in performing a series of powerful arcane rituals in order to stabilise or disrupt The Great Vortex, while foiling the progress of the other races. Each Legendary Lord has a unique geographical starting position, and each race offers a distinctive new playstyle with unique campaign mechanics, narrative, methods of war, armies, monsters, Lores of Magic, legendary characters, and staggering new battlefield army abilities.Shortly after launch, owners of both the original game and Total War™ WARHAMMER II will gain access to the colossal third campaign. Exploring a single open-world epic map covering the Old World and the New World, players may embark on monumental campaigns as any owned Race from both titles.Conquer the world, togetherEach of the Races in Total War™ WARHAMMER II will be playable in single and multiplayer campaign, plus custom and multiplayer battles. As the two Legendary Lords for each race all have their own unique campaign start positions, you’ll be able to play a 2-player co-op campaign as the same race. If you own both parts 1 and 2, you’ll be able to play in multiplayer as any of the races you own.  The World of Total War: WARHAMMER IIMillennia ago, besieged by a Chaos invasion, a conclave of High Elf mages forged a vast, arcane vortex. Its purpose was to draw the Winds of Magic from the world as a sinkhole drains an ocean, and blast the Daemonic hordes back to the Realm of Chaos. Now the Great Vortex falters, and the world again stands at the brink of ruin.Powerful forces move to heal the maelstrom and avert catastrophe. Yet others seek to harness its terrible energies for their own bitter purpose. The race is on, and the very fate of the world will lie in the hands of the victor. Prince Tyrion, Defender of Ulthuan, guides the High Elves in their desperate efforts to stabilise the vortex as it roils above their home continent.Atop his palanquin-throne, the Slann Mage-Priest Mazdamundi directs his Lizardmen war-hosts as they surge northward from Lustria. He, too, is intent on preventing cataclysm, though the methods of The Old Ones must prevail. The Witch King Malekith and his sadistic Dark Elf hordes spew forth from Naggaroth and their labyrinthine Black Arks. He tastes great weakness in the vortex – and great opportunity in its demise.Meanwhile the Skaven, led by Queek Headtaker, stir in their foetid subterranean tunnels. There they multiply unchecked and look hungrily towards the surface, their motives obscured. The time for revelation is nigh…Four races, four outcomes, a single goal: control of the Great Vortex, for good or ill.","['Strategy', 'Fantasy', 'Turn-Based Strategy', 'RTS', 'Grand Strategy', 'War', 'Multiplayer', 'Games Workshop', 'Action', 'Turn-Based', 'Singleplayer', 'Dark Fantasy', 'Co-op', 'Tactical', 'Real Time Tactics', 'Story Rich', 'Atmospheric', 'Dwarf', 'Dinosaurs', 'Great Soundtrack']","['OS *: Windows 7 64Bit', 'Processor: Intel® Core™ 2 Duo 3.0Ghz', 'Memory: 5 GB RAM', 'Graphics: NVIDIA GTX 460 1GB | AMD Radeon HD 5770 1GB | Intel HD4000 @720p', 'DirectX: Version 11', 'Storage: 60 GB available space']","['OS *: Windows 7 / 8 (8.1)/ 10 64Bit', 'Processor: Intel® Core™ i5-4570 3.20GHz', 'Memory: 8 GB RAM', 'Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 770 4GB | AMD Radeon R9 290X 4GB @1080p', 'DirectX: Version 11', 'Storage: 60 GB available space']","28 Sep, 2017","['CREATIVE ASSEMBLY', 'Feral Interactive (Mac)', 'Feral Interactive (Linux)']","['SEGA', 'Feral Interactive (Mac)', 'Feral Interactive (Linux)']",Very Positive,"(83,365)","67,315",https://store.steampowered.com/app/594570/Total_War_WARHAMMER_II?snr=1_category_4_strategy_salebrowseall

Total War: WARHAMMER III - Shadows of Change,,"About This Content
							The Shadows of Change pack introduces 3 new Legendary Lords for Tzeentch, Grand Cathay, and Kislev, usable in both the Realm of Chaos and Immortal Empires campaigns. Inject new Legendary Lords, Heroes, and Units into your games to vastly expand your methods of play on the campaign map and within battles. The Changeling, Yuan Bo, and Mother Ostankya each bring their own unique campaign mechanics to their faction, with goals separate from the Realm of Chaos campaign, and new units to help them pursue victory on their terms.3 new Legendary Lords emerge from the shadows. Perform dastardly schemes and trickery with the Changeling of Tzeentch. Establish and execute grand stratagems on a global scale as Yuan Bo of Grand Cathay. Conjure powerful hexes and incantations whilst engaging in witchcraft, flipping campaigns on their head as Mother Ostankya of Kislev.  Embrace change with 3 new Legendary Heroes. Scatter magical spells at random with the Blue Scribes of Tzeentch, field Tzarina’s boldest champion with the Golden Knight of Kislev, Naryska Leysa, and strike from afar with the Sentinel of the Heavens, Saytang the Watcher, for Grand Cathay.Enact unsettling rituals with the Lore of the Hag; a new spell lore for Mother Ostankya and Kislev.Expand your rosters with 16 additional units, enhance your troops with 9 Regiments of Renown, and bolster your leadership with a new Lord and Hero for all 3 races. I make my home in the darkest pits of your soul. In the shadows, I bide my time. As a mighty Horror of Tzeentch, the Changeling embodies the Changer of Ways’ most deceiving and manipulative tendencies. Able to morph into any legendary character from the noble to the fearsome, the Changeling’s true form has been lost to time. His trickery may even deceive the Dark Gods themselves, able to mirror foes, create false allies, and disrupt empires from within, with only one truth becoming clear long after he’s enacted his handiwork. The deceiving prankster of the known world, the Changeling of Tzeentch, was here. As a spellcasting shapeshifter bolstering the Lore of Tzeentch, the Changeling can adopt the form of any lord he faces, making his battle efficiency grow stronger as your enemy tries to do the same. When not fighting directly, he lingers in the shadows, stalking his prey, and waiting for the optimal time to strike. Trust no one. The Changeling’s inscrutable and random nature is the perfect recipe for schemes and trickery. For the Changeling, the world is divided into Theatres; segmented regions that contain Schemes, both minor and pivotal. Fuelled by an unending legion of tricksy cultists, to achieve his goals he must first break a Theatre down through smaller, cheekier Schemes by constructing buildings, stealing identities, and instigating tensions amongst otherwise civilized populations, culminating in a Grand Scheme and an epic battle for supremacy, rife with bountiful rewards along the way. Gold, Grimoires, and Rifts aplenty.  With enough Grand Schemes carried out, the Changeling’s final purpose is within reach: conducting the Ultimate Scheme for campaign victory.  This troublesome Legendary Hero, the Blue Scribes, ride atop their Disc of Tzeentch, scribbling on parchment as they go, and are capable of spewing all manner of spells across the battlefield by verbalising their scrolls. If only they knew what those words meant... Those in other nations may deny it, but all mortals desire control. To be controlled, that is. Ruling over Central Cathay, Yuan Bo, the Jade Dragon leads the Court of Celestial Sorcerers. A bureaucrat of the highest order on the surface, yes, but a talented spymaster at heart, the Jade Dragon runs the city of Wei-jin and, by extension, is an administrator for the Cathay empire. Liked by all, the good of Grand Cathay is in capable hands.  Serving two roles between his human and dragon forms, the Jade Dragon can be a devastating single target destroyer, and a potent spellcaster with the Light, Yin, and Heaven lores of magic. Soar above the battlefield as a dragon, burning down even the strongest of enemy units, or take the fight on the ground with game-changing spells at your side. Cathay stands, all the same.  Engage in a chess match unlike any other with the Matters of State. As a master statesman, a right hand to the emperor and a spymaster, Yuan Bo’s influence over the kingdom runs deep. With this power, enact overt and covert policies across settlements, armies and even characters to best suit your empire’s needs. Crack down on settlement corruption, rush construction for your entire empire in a single move, create diplomatic deadlocks to move freely through unfriendly territories, and much, much more. Go beyond mere balance and embrace disharmony, leveraging it as an excuse to serve more severe and extreme actions to fit your agenda, and plan chains of actions to ensure the balance of harmony is pulled back in your favour when all is said and done.  Yuan Bo doesn’t follow the rules. He writes them. With a plan centuries in the making under the request of Yuan Bo’s father, the Jade Dragon is tasked with travelling to critical locations and constructing relays to empower the Jade Compass, before defending them from the Lizardmen incursions trying to dismantle Cathay. Destroy them, and plot a course to victory.  For years we thought she was a child's tale to frighten us into behaving. Then one day, in my twentieth winter, I got too close to the woods. And when I was told Mother Ostankya would get you... I knew if I took one step closer to the trees it would be true. Tales of monsters and bogeymen have haunted many lands for centuries, but the tale hanging above the Kislevite children, a reminder of the consequences for displaying disobedience, was not just a tale. Mother Ostankya is real. A guardian, faithful to the land, holding anyone who seeks to harm it accountable, she draws her power from the very woods, fens and oblasts that she protects. When war comes knocking, she’ll be on the front lines, protecting the warriors of Kislev, and inflicting her terror upon any who oppose them. And if you cross her path, make no mistake. Mother Ostankya will punish you. As a powerful sorceress with a bespoke melee component, Mother Ostankya utilises her cauldron on and off the battlefield, able to rain spirits down upon her foes from afar or sprout the legs of a spider in melee combat as an artillery-chariot hybrid.  The Daughters of the Forest must infuse Mother Ostankya’s Witchcraft at the Witch’s Hut. With a new rare resource, Spirit Essence, you can take advantage of ingredients gathered during your playthrough to create potent Incantations and utilise Hexes to vastly change the course of your entire campaign.  Force enemy armies from your lands in an instant, purge entire provinces of corruption in a single move, buff your units far beyond their given capability, and unleash the full might of the witch as you search for the Malediction of Ruin; Mother Ostankya’s final Hex to secure the sanctity of Kislevite land. Welcome a world of change with new additional units for Tzeentch, Grand Cathay, and Kislev. Field an abomination with the Mutalith Vortex Beast for Tzeentch, a horrific fusion of monster and magic, created by the powers of Chaos beyond any justifiable reason. It brings raw, magical destruction to the table with violent spectacle. It won’t take a compass to find the new additions to the Cathayan roster. Crafted by the wizards of the Celestial Court, Guardian Lions are living statues made from Jet or Jade. For those seeking a magical touch, the Jade Lion is a sorcerer's conduit, able to use spells bound to its body and launch flaming attacks. The Jet Lion, however, is the opposite, countering magical spells to diminish any sorcery that may harm themselves or those nearby. Plus, new Kislevite units lurk in these woods. A terrible and frightening creature, known to many as The Thing in the Woods, brings its enormous size and infantry sundering capability to the frontlines of Kislev. Left unchecked, this beast will tear through enemy troops like paper, before rushing into the woods for cover and emerging to do it all over again.  And, of course, further horrors await within the Shadows of Change.","['Strategy', 'Action', 'Dark Fantasy', 'Grand Strategy', 'Fantasy', 'RTS', 'Turn-Based Strategy', 'Psychological Horror', 'Real Time Tactics', 'Atmospheric', 'Singleplayer', 'Online Co-Op', 'Tactical', 'War', 'Co-op', 'Multiplayer', 'PvP', 'Colorful', 'Story Rich']","['OS *: Windows 7 64-bit', 'Processor: Intel i3/Ryzen 3 series', 'Memory: 6 GB RAM', 'Graphics: Nvidia GTX 900/AMD RX 400 series | Intel Iris Xe Graphics', 'DirectX: Version 11', 'Storage: 120 GB available space', 'Additional Notes: This game may be updated over time and have paid for and free. additional content released for it.

In this world, you’ll experience all kinds of unusual illnesses; from Light-headedness to Cubism – each requiring their very own special type of treatment machine. Diagnose illnesses, build the right rooms to handle them, hire the right staff, and then get ready, because curing just one of these illnesses is just the beginning. You can handle a single patient – but can you handle a Pandemic? Once you’ve conquered an illness, research improved cures and machines and turn your hospital into an unstoppable healthcare juggernaut. Improve and expand your hospital horizons!Your first hospital is where it begins, but what next? Once you’ve cured the residents of a small harbour village, can you take on a bigger challenge in a busier hospital? Improve your facilities, upgrade machines, staff and layouts to make more money, more quickly. Train and improve your staff, levelling them up with new skills and abilities to make your hospital even more efficient. Make use of the extensive statistic and information screens to analyse your strengths and weaknesses, and make rapid alterations. Adjust the price of your treatments, keep an eye on your turnover, take out loans and optimise your earnings.You’ll be managing staff with unique personality types and traits, so you’ll need to keep an eye on who’s being efficient – and who is just a pain in the neck. Balance your workforce with your ambitions as you strive to make profit (and hopefully save some people along the way).","['Simulation', 'Medical Sim', 'Management', 'Building', 'Funny', 'Singleplayer', 'Strategy', 'Sandbox', 'Indie', 'Comedy', 'Casual', 'City Builder', 'Replay Value', 'Cartoony', 'Multiplayer', 'Isometric', 'Family Friendly', 'Classic', 'Retro', 'Tactical']","['Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system', 'OS *: Windows 7 64-bit', 'Processor: Intel Core i3 6100 or AMD FX-4350', 'Memory: 4 GB RAM', 'Graphics: NVIDIA Geforce GT 1030, 2GB (Legacy: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 460), AMD RX550, 2GB (Legacy: AMD Radeon HD 6850), Integrated: Intel HD Graphics 630', 'DirectX: Version 11', 'Storage: 6 GB available space']","['Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system', 'OS: Windows 10  64-bit', 'Processor: Intel Core i5 6600 or AMD Ryzen 1600x', 'Memory: 8 GB RAM', 'Graphics: NVIDIA Geforce GTX 1060, 3 GB (Legacy: NVIDIA Geforce GTX 780, 4GB) or AMD RX 580, 4 GB (Legacy: AMD R9 290X, 4GB)', 'DirectX: Version 11', 'Storage: 6 GB available space']","29 Aug, 2018",['Two Point Studios'],['SEGA'],Very Positive,"(24,391)","15,451",https://store.steampowered.com/app/535930/Two_Point_Hospital?snr=1_category_4_strategy_salebrowseall

Manor Lords,"Manor Lords is a medieval strategy game featuring in-depth city building, large-scale tactical battles, and complex economic and social simulations. Rule your lands as a medieval lord – the seasons pass, the weather changes, and cities rise and fall.","About This Game
Manor Lords is a strategy game that allows you to experience the life of a medieval lord. Grow your starting village into a bustling city, manage resources and production chains, and expand your lands through conquest.Inspired by the art and architecture of late 14th century Franconia, Manor Lords prioritizes historical accuracy wherever possible, using it to inform gameplay mechanics and visuals alike. Common medieval tropes are avoided in favor of historical accuracy in order to make the world feel more authentic, colorful, and believable.Manor Lords provides a gridless city-building experience with full freedom of placement and rotation. Building mechanics are inspired by the growth of real medieval towns and villages, where major trade routes and the landscape influenced how settlements formed and developed.Spreading outward from a central marketplace, build your residential, commercial, and industrial districts following the natural lay of the land. Establish farms based on soil fertility, position hunting grounds according to animal populations, and ensure access to adequate resource deposits and forests to provide the raw materials needed for growth.Assign areas for housing and watch your residents build their homes in accordance with the historical burgage plot system. Each area will be subdivided based on your roads and the allotted space, and homes will scale accordingly.Build extensions behind larger homes to generate resources that would not otherwise be available. Homeowners don't just pay taxes – they grow vegetables, raise chickens and goats, and otherwise supply themselves and other townsfolk with essential needs beyond what your managed farms, pastures, and industries can provide.Guide your settlements through the unique demands and opportunities of each season, enjoying the bounty brought by spring rains and preparing for the harsh snows of winter.From boots to barley and hides to honey, Manor Lords features a great variety of goods fitting of the era. Materials need to be transported and processed into finished products through production chains, and you must balance the basic needs of your people against the desire to produce luxury items to ensure happiness, manufacture trade goods for export, or forge arms and armor to aid in your conquests.  Resources are littered across the map, encouraging you to expand and establish multiple specialized settlements. Extract valuable ores from your mining colonies, while villages devoted to agriculture, herding, or hunting supply the grains and meats needed to feed your growing populations. Will you spend your hard-earned influence to first acquire a rich source of iron for your smiths, or will you prioritize regions with fertile soil to serve as your breadbasket? Unchecked expansion will have a direct effect on the environment. Herds of deer will migrate away from encroaching civilization, lack of crop rotation will worsen soil fertility, and cutting down too many trees will result in deforestation.Establish trade routes and sell surplus goods to traveling merchants to enrich your population. Manufacturing and exporting a variety of goods will provide wealth with which to upgrade your peoples’ homes, import goods you can’t produce yourself, and through taxes on said wealth, fill your own coffers.Yours is but a small parcel of land in a vast territory, and the competing ambitions between you and rival lords will inevitably lead to conflict. Lead your people into battle, not as expendable units to be easily replenished, but as your beloved loyal subjects where every death is a cost worth considering.Train a retinue of skilled warriors to fight battles alongside the levies you raise from the town militia. At times these soldiers will be needed to suppress banditry, and at other times you will lead your men into battle to conquer or defend territory. When needed, mercenaries are a costly option to bolster your ranks. Will you raise the militia at the first sign of trouble, bringing your economy to a stand-still as your peasants pick up arms and rush to form ranks, or will you spend your personal wealth to hire bands of sellswords instead?Command real-time tactical battles, taking into consideration fatigue, weather conditions, and equipment. Position your troops wisely – a smaller force can defeat a larger enemy, if commanded well.Feel the cost of battle, even in victory, as each fallen soldier represents a lost person from your city.This game is a passion project started by a solo developer. You can reach out to me and share your opinions, ideas, and criticisms - I listen to your feedback.","['Strategy', 'City Builder', 'Simulation', 'Base Building', 'Grand Strategy', 'Management', 'Building', 'Resource Management', 'Sandbox', 'Colony Sim', 'Historical', 'Survival', 'Open World', 'Moddable', 'Singleplayer', 'Medieval', 'RTS', 'Early Access', 'Replay Value', 'Economy']","['Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system', 'OS: Windows® 10 (64-bit)', 'Processor: Intel® Core™ i5-4670 (quad-core)  / AMD® FX-Series™ FX-4350 (quad-core)', 'Memory: 8 GB RAM', 'Graphics: NVIDIA® GeForce® GTX 1050 (2 GB) / AMD® Radeon™ RX-460 (4 GB)  / Intel® Arc™ A380 (6 GB)', 'DirectX: Version 12', 'Storage: 15 GB available space']","['Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system', 'OS: Windows® 10 (64-bit)', 'Processor: Intel® Core™ i5-7600 (quad-core) / AMD® Ryzen™ 3 2200G (quad-core)', 'Memory: 12 GB RAM', 'Graphics: NVIDIA® GeForce® GTX 1060 (6 GB) / AMD® Radeon™ RX 580 (8 GB)  / Intel® Arc™ A580 (8 GB)', 'DirectX: Version 12', 'Storage: 15 GB available space']","26 Apr, 2024",['Slavic Magic'],['Hooded Horse'],Very Positive,"(47,473)","27,736",https://store.steampowered.com/app/1363080/Manor_Lords?snr=1_category_4_strategy_salebrowseall

Check Out Our Other Game!Stolen RealmTURN-BASED STRATEGY MEETS ACTION RPG IN THIS DUNGEON CRAWLING LOOTERStolen Realm is a simultaneous turn-based tactical dungeon crawling looter with action RPG elements where you control up to 6 heroes, solo or through online co-op, venturing forth in adventures set in a high-fantasy, low-poly world. Stolen Realm features an innovative turn-based combat system where simultaneous turns allow every team to take their actions at once, creating quick combat encounters that blend the tactical depth of titles like Divinity: Original Sin with the thrill of a fast-paced action RPG. Every battle scales based on the number of players involved, so you can easily jump in and out of the game even in the same playthrough! With a highly customisable class system, Stolen Realm allows you to create traditional RPG classes or break the mold to forge a unique champion of your own as you draw from a pool of hundreds of possible skills. Make a spell-slinging assassin, a priest born of frost, or a shadow-infused knight. Further customize your build by earning and reforging loot that truly changes the way you play: wield Abbadon the Soul Crusher, a mythic mace that raises slain enemies as skeletal warriors to fight for you, or unsheath the Bloodletter, a cursed sword that grants additional power at the cost of your lifeblood. D&D-like events where attribute-based rolls will have permanent effects on your character add yet another layer to building a character that is truly your own. Anything is possible in this title that keeps compelling choices at the forefront of your experience.  Keeping the core appeal of RPGs at its forefront, Stolen Realm ensures you spend all your time, fighting, building your characters and making compelling choices that determine your immediate path or effect your character, rather than getting bogged down in side quests and other RPG-bloat.   After each battle, pick your path between story events, resource gathering, shops and treasure rooms, until you get to the final boss of each procedurally generated adventure. If you’re up to a challenge, crank the difficulty up with 6 different difficulty levels – or pick Hardcore Mode with permadeath, where every battle can be the last!Also features Roguelike Mode, a fast paced version of the game where you can mix and match builds that are simply not possible in the traditional campaign!Carve a place in history with your sword and magic.

Sins of a Solar Empire II,"Battle for galactic dominance in this real-time 4X strategy game with unrivaled scale! You’ll explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate through military force, diplomacy, trade, culture, influence, and other underhanded tactics.","About This Game
							Sins of a Solar Empire II is the sequel to the critically acclaimed space strategy game that seamlessly blends real-time battle tactics with the depth of 4X. As both emperor and battle commander you must lead one of six playable factions to victory against the threat of extinction!Real-time Tactics meets 4X DepthThere are no turns. There is no battle mode. There is no strategic mode. It's all one mode and it's all in real-time.Instantly zoom in to control tactical engagements where every missile, turret, and ship is fully simulated and an important part of the battle. Instantly zoom back out to manage your empire where every asteroid, moon, and planet orbits its parent in a slowly evolving strategic landscape.Unparalleled Gameplay ExperiencesSins of a Solar Empire II delivers sprawling empires, huge fleets, and completely new and exciting gameplay moments that can only be found in Sins II. The Surprise: Build a secondary fleet on a rogue asteroid and launch a devastating surprise attack when its orbit brings it behind the enemy's back line. The Body Block: Stall an enemy's home planet bombardment by using your massive titan to body block swarms of missiles attempting to knock out your starbase and its critical planetary shield. The Screen: Advance a screen of point defense flak frigates to protect your fragile long-range cruisers by intercepting incoming bombers and missiles. The Swarm: Maneuver your faster moving ships to pick apart unescorted larger ships. Their powerful but slow-moving turrets simply can't track your agile strike force. The Influencer: Influence a hostile expansionist Minor Faction to secure your border while reserving enough Influence to win an auction for a powerful item to install on your best capital ship. The Backstab: Protect yourself from a backstab by establishing a time locked alliance. But pay attention to the time - your “ally” may move his fleet to your doorstep just as the lock expires!FeaturesA Dynamic Galaxy: Planets orbit their stars in real-time causing the galaxy's structure to slowly change, creating new battle fronts and new opportunities. Players can view the state of the galaxy up to an hour in the future to prepare their strategies.3 Unique Races: It's War Year 35 and the emergent TEC, alien Vasari, and deviant Advent have been forced to adapt and evolve to survive. TEC: The inhabitants of this region of the galaxy, the TEC are humans who have joined together as the Trader Emergency Coalition to combat the alien Vasari empire. They rely heavily on trade to support their industrial base and augment resource income. Vasari: Ten thousand years ago, the Vasari Empire once ruled over hundreds of planets and dozens of sentient species. Now on the run from an unknown enemy they use their mastery of phase space to conquer and acquire resources to continue their exodus. Advent: A civilization of humans who were forcibly outcast by the Traders over a thousand years ago, the deviant Advent have returned with technologically amplified psionics and the power of the Unity - a devastating expression of their collective will.Each race features unique starting conditions, gameplay mechanics, units, abilities, items, and technologies. Their game changing new Empire Systems add a whole new level of strategic capabilities: TEC Trade: The new TEC trade system enables them to dynamically adapt their economy by adjusting the allocation of traded resources on demand. Vasari Phase Resonance: Strategically placed structures collect Phase Resonance allowing the Vasari to customize their global phase mastery effects. Advent Unity: Enables the Advent to harness the collective will of their population, unlocking the full potential of the Unity's global abilities.6 Playable Factions: The parent races are further differentiated by unique sub-factions each with their own unique features and play styles that reflect their motivations and goals. For example, the TEC: Primacy is a xenophobic 'human first' empire focused on aggression and the Vasari: Exodus is willing to destroy planets to fuel their mobile empire. Combat Simulation: A detailed combat simulation adds incredible depth to tactical gameplay. Turrets with their own pitch and tracking speeds make firing solutions important in battles. Fully simulated missiles can be blocked by ships or destroyed by point defense. New mechanics around shields, armor and hull points give greater depth to units and tactical decisions.Empire Management: All planets and ships can now be easily analyzed, customized, and upgraded in one place without the tedium of finding and clicking through all units in your empire. The Intelligent Construction system will queue up the entire chain of prerequisites to fulfill any item, research, or unit build request.Fleet Management: The new fleet system includes the ability to request specific reinforcements on the fly. Requested units are automatically queued from the optimal factory and rallied to the fleet. Combined with Intelligent Construction this allows you to focus on the important tactical decisions and big picture strategy.Unit Customization: Planet surfaces can now be customized with special items that vary by race and planet type. Capital ships, titans and starbases can also be customized with race specific items to fill gaps in the fleet's composition or target specific strategies.Minor Factions: Numerous minor factions now inhabit the galaxy offering trade, auctions for rare items, and with enough influence, access to their most powerful abilities. Will you befriend them or annihilate them to keep your enemies from turning them against you?Diplomacy: New features include a new offer / counteroffer system, the ability to give or demand planets, and the game changing time locked cease-fires that prevent your 'ally' from backstabbing you until it expires - but keep on eye on the time!Multicore 64-bit Engine: The Sins II engine can utilize all available cores and RAM to maximize performance, now and into the future. Dynamic lighting, physically based rendering, higher resolution textures and more create a beautiful tapestry.10-Player Multiplayer Support: A cloud based online system supports both 'join codes' and lobbies to make it easier than ever to play with others. Games can now be rejoined in progress if a player drops or has to leave; humans can even take over for AI players if a friend joins late.In-game Mod Support: Mod support has been integrated into the game, making it easy to discover, install, and share mods. Custom maps are automatically shared for multiplayer games, preventing the hassle of everyone downloading ahead of time.Easy to Learn; Hard to Master: With an elegant and intuitive user interface Sins II is easy to pick up and play. However, mastering your chosen faction will take true skill.","['Strategy', 'Space', '4X', 'RTS', 'Sci-fi', 'Singleplayer', 'Multiplayer', 'Tactical', 'Story Rich', 'Co-op', 'PvE', 'PvP', 'Immersive Sim', 'Real-Time', '3D', 'Base Building', 'Tutorial', 'Competitive', 'Choices Matter', 'Isometric']","['Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system', 'OS: Windows 10 v1607+ / 11 (64-bit)', 'Processor: 4-core Processor (Intel Core i5 5th-generation or AMD Ryzen 2x00 series)', 'Memory: 8 GB RAM', 'Graphics: 3D Video Card w/2GB VRAM (Nvidia GeForce 950 / AMD Radeon RX 450)', 'DirectX: Version 11', 'Network: Broadband Internet connection', 'Storage: 20 GB available space', 'Additional Notes: 1920x1080 minimum screen resolution']","['Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system', 'OS: Windows 11', 'Processor: 8-core Processor (Intel Core i7 9th-generation or AMD Ryzen 3x00 series)', 'Memory: 16 GB RAM', 'Graphics: 3D Video Card w/4GB+ VRAM (Nvidia GeForce 1060 or AMD Radeon 580)', 'DirectX: Version 11', 'Network: Broadband Internet connection', 'Storage: 20 GB available space', 'Additional Notes: 1920x1080 minimum screen resolution']","15 Aug, 2024","['Ironclad Games Corporation', 'Stardock Entertainment']",['Stardock Entertainment'],Very Positive,"(3,953)","3,365",https://store.steampowered.com/app/1575940/Sins_of_a_Solar_Empire_II?snr=1_category_4_strategy_100726

Frostpunk,"Frostpunk is the first society survival game. As the ruler of the last city on Earth, it is your duty to manage both its citizens and infrastructure. What decisions will you make to ensure your society's survival? What will you do when pushed to breaking point? Who will you become in the process?","About This Game
END OF THE ROADSince the premiere, Frostpunk has been enriched with a number of updates. You can enjoy the new Endless Mode (with 3 ways of playing it) that increases the replayability of the game. There is also a new scenario - The Fall of Winterhome, that further expands the game’s universe and lore. And for the dessert, we’ve added things like naming characters and automatons and finally a photo mode. All of this is available for free for all the owners of the game. There are also three expansions, available with the paid Season Pass. At the same time we would like to inform you that we are not planning to create any more content for Frostpunk, as this journey is over for us, but there are more to come in the future, so be sure to keep an eye out for our games. Of course the game will still receive patches and fixes and we’ll provide the technical support.SEASON PASSThe Official Season Pass for Frostpunk is out and complete! It grants you access to all additional content released for the game since the premiere, including three expansions (The Last Autumn, On The Edge and The Rifts), that widely broaden the main story and fill a lot of gaps in the game’s universe. What’s more, when you’re done with the game itself, you’ll be able to unwind while listening to the Digital Soundtrack featuring orchestrated music or learn more about the world with the exclusive Digital Artbook. Not having the game at all? Worry no more, as the Frostpunk: Game of the Year Edition is what you are looking for. It includes the main game, season pass and all exclusive content at a discounted price.ABOUT THE GAMETHE CITY MUST SURVIVEFrostpunk, the newest title from the creators of This War of Mine, is a society survival game where heat means life and every decision comes at a price. In an entirely frozen world, people develop steam-powered technology to oppose the overwhelming cold. You face the task of building the last city on Earth and securing the means necessary for your community to survive. Optimization and resource management often clash with empathy and thoughtful decision-making. While city and society management will consume most of the ruler’s time, at some point exploration of the outside world is necessary to understand its history and present state.What decisions will you make to ensure the survival of your society? What will you do when pushed to the limit? And who will you become in the process?MAKE THE LAWEstablish laws that regulate the existence of your growing society. Decide on their working routine, healthcare, food provision and other crucial aspects of everyday life. Maintain their hope and contentment – the moral condition of your society is as important as securing the basic means to keep them fed and safe.SHAPE YOUR SOCIETYIf you reach a turning point, do not hesitate to determine the path of your people. Should you rule them with an iron fist... or show them a way of compassion and faith? Reach for extremes or try to find a fair balance. Whichever you choose, remember: there’s no turning back.WEIGH UP YOUR CHOICESSome of your decisions will seem small – like deciding the fate of a troubled citizen or meeting the demands of a newborn faction – but be aware that the sum of your doings can lead to unexpected results. Your people put their faith in you, but their devotion is not limitless. Leadership can be a burden.DEVELOP NEW TECHNOLOGIESSurvival demands progress. React to current events, but don’t forget about the long term and investing in development and technological progress. Providing a highly advanced infrastructure with self-powered automatons, airships, and other technical wonders is difficult, but achievable. It all depends on your management and leadership skills.EXPLORE THE FROSTLANDWhile New London is your main focus, there is much more to the world than what lies within the limits of your city. Expeditions, while risky, can bring you valuable intel, precious supplies and grow your society’s population. There may be people out there, and their fate lies solely in your hands.PLAY ENDLESSLYFrostpunk Endless Mode grants you unlimited replayability for the game. Play on 8 various maps, with different terrain, weather conditions and challenges to face. We know that different people look for different experiences and that’s why there are 3 modes to play in Endless Mode. Endurance will be an ultimate test to your building, managing and survival skills in the harshest conditions. Builders, where there is no generator available from the start, which creates a different type of challenge. And last but not least, Serenity which is focused on enjoying the art of building the city itself, without unnecessary pressure.","['City Builder', 'Survival', 'Resource Management', 'Strategy', 'Post-apocalyptic', 'Steampunk', 'Colony Sim', 'Building', 'Base Building', 'Singleplayer', 'Simulation', 'Management', 'Choices Matter', 'Atmospheric', 'Economy', 'Dark', 'Difficult', 'RTS', 'Great Soundtrack', 'Real-Time with Pause']","['Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system', 'OS *: Windows 7/8/10 64-bit', 'Processor: 3.2 GHz Dual Core Processor', 'Memory: 4 GB RAM', 'Graphics: GeForce GTX 660, Radeon R7 370 or equivalent with 2 GB of video RAM', 'DirectX: Version 11', 'Storage: 8 GB available space', 'Sound Card: DirectX compatible', ""Additional Notes: Please make sure that you have the latest VC package installed, and - if you're using Windows 7 or 8 - that you have the KB4019990 update applied.""]","['Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system', 'OS *: Windows 7/8/10 64-bit', 'Processor: 3.2 GHz Quad Core Processor', 'Memory: 8 GB RAM', 'Graphics: GeForce 970, Radeon RX 580 or equivalent with 4GB of video RAM', 'DirectX: Version 11', 'Storage: 8 GB available space', 'Sound Card: DirectX compatible', ""Additional Notes: Please make sure that you have the latest VC package installed, and - if you're using Windows 7 or 8 - that you have the KB4019990 update applied.""]","24 Apr, 2018",['11 bit studios'],['11 bit studios'],Very Positive,"(93,041)","40,384",https://store.steampowered.com/app/323190/Frostpunk?snr=1_category_4_strategy_100726

							Tactical Breach Wizards is a turn-based tactics game in which you lead a team of renegade wizards in kevlar, as they unravel a modern conspiracy plot and/or find the most stylish way to punch a Traffic Warlock through a 4th story window.It's a story-driven campaign of about 14 hours, in which you...Combo spells for satisfying resultsEach of your wizards has a unique set of abilities, from a straightforward lightning bolt to transforming into a rabid dog. Experiment freely, rewind your mistakesWhen you hit a tricky situation, try every wild idea you have - you can always rewind if it didn't pan out. It could work beautifully, fail spectacularly, or screw up in a way that gives you new ideas. Either way, free rewinds mean you play it out in-game instead of scratching your head.Fight the (various) power(s)Your team are a motley crew of misfits on the wrong side of the law, fighting against:The Rushwater PD and their rising star: Steve Clark, the Traffic WarlockAn oppressive religious dictatorship who rule the streets with Riot PriestsA private military corporation meddling with magic to enhance their troopsAnd the most deadly operative the trade has ever seen: the Black Ops ChronomancerUpgrade your magical arsenalEvery ability for every wizard has a set of unique perks to unlock as they level up, tailoring their powers to your playstyle, and enabling ridiculous ways they can combo with each other.Get to know these loveable idiotsTravel the world, meet interesting wizards, and find out what's wrong with them.

Here are some things it isn't!It's not a branching story. You do make choices in your conversations, but they don't cause major deviations in the course of the plot. They're more about deciding how you want this character to treat people, and how much you want to dig into or push back at what the other person is saying.It's not a roguelike. Every now and then someone will call it that and we don't know why! Every level is handcrafted.It's not XCOM. This is a much shorter, story-driven experience about a cast of unique characters. There's no base-building or equivalent.It's not Into the Breach. This is more forgiving, but the ceiling on how many different things you can do in a turn is higher.What is it?Come on, we just went over this with gifs and everything.","['Turn-Based Tactics', 'Puzzle', 'Story Rich', 'Turn-Based Strategy', 'Turn-Based', 'Funny', 'Singleplayer', 'Strategy RPG', 'Tactical', 'Tactical RPG', 'RPG', 'Adventure', 'Military', 'Indie', 'Mystery', 'Isometric', 'Comedy', 'Fantasy', 'Strategy', 'Satire']","['OS *: Windows 7', 'Processor: Intel Core 2 Duo E4700 2.6 GHz or AMD Phenom 9950 Quad Core 2.6 GHz', 'Memory: 8 GB RAM', 'Graphics: 1GB ATI Radeon HD 5770, 1GB NVIDIA GeForce GTX 460 or better', 'DirectX: Version 11', 'Storage: 3 GB available space']","['OS *: Windows 7', 'Processor: Intel Core 2 Duo E4700 2.6 GHz or AMD Phenom 9950 Quad Core 2.6 GHz', 'Memory: 8 GB RAM', 'Graphics: 1GB ATI Radeon HD 5770, 1GB NVIDIA GeForce GTX 460 or better', 'DirectX: Version 11', 'Storage: 3 GB available space']","22 Aug, 2024",['Suspicious Developments Inc'],['Suspicious Developments'],Overwhelmingly Positive,"(4,950)","4,766",https://store.steampowered.com/app/1043810/Tactical_Breach_Wizards?snr=1_category_4_strategy_100726

Ultimate General: Civil War is a tactical real time strategy war game. Experience the bloodiest period of U.S. history - the American Civil War of 1861-1865. MAIN FEATURESFull campaign: Fight in the American Civil War campaign and participate in 50+ battles from small engagements to massive battles that can last several days over hundreds of square miles of terrain. Campaign fully depends on player actions and battle results. Historical battles can also be played separately.The game includes the following battles in the campaign:Battle of Aquia CreekBattle of Philippi1st Battle of Bull RunBattle of ShilohBattle of Gaines' MillBattle of Malvern Hill2nd Battle of Bull RunBattle of AntietamBattle of FredericksburgBattle of Stones RiverBattle of ChancellorsvilleBattle of GettysburgBattle of ChickamaugaBattle of Cold HarborBattle of RichmondBattle of Washington+ 48 smaller scale battlesArmy management: You are the general. You have full control over the army composition. Based on your successes and reputation you might get access to more corps, divisions and brigades. Keep your soldiers alive and they will learn to fight better, turning from green rookies to crack veterans. Lose a lot of your soldiers and you might not have enough reinforcements to deliver victories. Your reputation will suffer, army morale will drop and you will be forced to resign.Innovative command system: You decide which level of control you want. Command every unit individually or just give them a main goal with one button click and watch if they can take that hill. Army divisions commanders can make decisions on their own and help you control the largest army. Draw a defensive line and allocated brigades will defend it like lions. Or design a deep flanking maneuver by just drawing an arrow and send the whole army to the enemy flank or the rear. Your generals will try to fulfill your orders, although ""no plan survives contact with the enemy"".Officer progression: Historical unit commanders progress and become better fighters together with the player. The Officers rank up based on their units’ performance, but it's war and they can be wounded or even get killed in action. New ranks open new possibilities and allow officers to lead bigger units without efficiency loss. Winning battles also opens new possibilities for you as a general, increasing skills such as reconnaissance or political influence.Historical weapons: There is huge variety of Civil War weaponry from mass produced Enfield pattern rifles to rare Whitworths. Historical availability has also been implemented. Certain weapons can only be captured by raiding supplies or taken from the enemy on the battlefield. Enhanced unit control: Detach skirmishers to send them to scout those hills ahead. Or merge several brigades into one bigger division if it’s needed. Dismount the cavalry to become less visible to the enemy or mount for fast flanking charges and supply raids. Supplies are extremely important and you have to plan and defend the provisions otherwise the battle might end for you early.Advanced Artificial Intelligence: You will face a strong enemy. AI will flank you, will hit your weak spots and undefended high ground, will chase and cut your supplies and will try to destroy unguarded artillery batteries. AI will use terrain and will take cover and retreat if overwhelmed. Terrain matters: Trenches, lines, fences, houses, fields – everything can help to achieve victory, if you know how to use it. Hills will allow you to see enemy units earlier. Rivers and bridges can become natural obstacles that will help you to defend. Forests can help you hide your movements and flank the enemy. Beautiful maps: We believe that modern technology allows hardcore war-games to finally stop being brown on green hexes. Hardcore, deep war games can be beautiful. In our game, every historical battle landscape is accurately hand-drawn, utilizing data from satellite and historical maps. The topography plays immense strategic role and helps to understand how battles were fought and to learn history.","['Wargame', 'Real Time Tactics', 'War', 'America', 'Tabletop', 'RTS', 'Grand Strategy', 'Strategy', 'Historical', 'Board Game', 'Strategy RPG', 'Education', 'Turn-Based Strategy', 'Tactical', 'Military', 'Combat', 'Simulation', 'Singleplayer', 'Multiplayer', 'Indie']","['OS *: Windows 7 - 32 bit', 'Processor: Intel i3', 'Memory: 2 GB RAM', 'Graphics: 512Mb VRAM, Minimum 1366x768 resolution, Intel HD 4000 and higher, GeForce 8800 and higher, AMD Radeon X1600', 'DirectX: Version 9.0', 'Storage: 2 GB available space']","['OS: Windows 10 - 64 bits', 'Processor: Intel i5', 'Memory: 2 GB RAM', 'Graphics: 1GB VRAM, 1920x1080 resolution, Nvidia 960 or  Radeon R9 285', 'DirectX: Version 9.0', 'Storage: 2 GB available space']","14 Jul, 2017",['Game-Labs'],['Game-Labs'],Very Positive,"(7,428)","5,197",https://store.steampowered.com/app/502520/Ultimate_General_Civil_War?snr=1_category_4_strategy_100727

The Imperium awaits.In Dune: Imperium, you'll step into the role of one of the leaders of the Great Houses of the Imperium in a struggle to control the planet Arrakis and the invaluable Spice it provides.The game plays out in a series of ten rounds, each of which is defined by a new Conflict on the surface of the planet; some award critical resources, and some provide Victory Points that will propel you to dominance. But choose your battles wisely: spread your forces too thin, and you'll find your enemies growing too strong to oppose.Each round, you'll draw a hand of five cards from your deck, which will get stronger over the course of the game as you acquire new cards. Each card can be played in one of two ways: To send an Agent out into the Imperium to gather resources, or to Reveal at the end of the round to purchase new powerful cards. You must maintain a careful balance to get the most of the resources available to you. How will you find your path?As your game progresses, you'll vie for Influence with four factions of the Imperium: The Emperor, the economically powerful Spacing Guild, the mysterious Bene Gesserit, and the ferocious Fremen of the deep deserts. Earning Influence among the various groups helps you to earn the Victory Points you need...but will you compete with your rivals for their favor, or abandon alliances to pursue other opportunities?Many strategies are at your disposal, and many paths to victory. The cards are dealt. The choice is yours. The Imperium awaits.","['Board Game', 'Strategy', 'Deckbuilding', 'Sci-fi', 'Simulation', 'Card Game', 'Grand Strategy', 'Tabletop', 'Space Sim', 'Top-Down', 'Dystopian', 'Economy', 'Fantasy', 'Futuristic', 'Lore-Rich', 'Military', 'Political', 'Space', 'Choices Matter', 'Combat']","['Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system', 'OS: Windows 10 (64bit version only)', 'Processor: Intel Core i5-2400 or AMD Ryzen 3 2200G', 'Memory: 4 GB RAM', 'Graphics: Intel HD 2000 graphics or Vega 8 graphics', 'DirectX: Version 11', 'Storage: 2 GB available space']","['Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system', 'OS: Windows 10 or better (64bit version only)', 'Processor: NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GT (512 MB) or ATI Radeon HD 4850 (512 MB) or better', 'Memory: 8 GB RAM', 'Graphics: Graphics card with DX11 or OpenGL 3.x capabilities', 'DirectX: Version 11', 'Network: Broadband Internet connection', 'Storage: 5 GB available space']","13 Mar, 2024",['Dire Wolf'],['Dire Wolf'],Overwhelmingly Positive,"(2,104)","1,470",https://store.steampowered.com/app/1689500/Dune_Imperium?snr=1_category_4_strategy_100727

Scythe: Digital Edition,"Scythe transports you to an alternate reality in 1920s Europa, one ravaged by the First World War. Take up the role of leader by assuming command of one of 5 factions, and set out to conquer the coveted ""Factory"". Lead your mechs to war and your people to victory!","About This Game
In an alternate reality in 1920s Europa, it's been several years since the ""Great War"", but the ashes of the conflict are still hot and the war is entering a new phase. The first conflict saw the emergence of some incredible engines of war known as Mechs. Built by ""The Factory"", an independent city-state which has since become the object of everyone's desire, these technological monstrosities roam the snowy landscapes of Europa. Be the hero of one of the five factions – Saxony Empire, Crimean Khanate, Rusviet Union, Polania Republic or Nordic Kingdom – and become the richest and most powerful nation in all of Europa during these dark times! To assure the victory of your people, you will need to explore and conquer new territories, enlist new recruits and deploy your forces by building formidable and terrifying combat Mechs. Replay history in a fictional past full of mechanical engines and technology, where each choice you make will be critical. Choose your battles with care, because in Scythe, victory is achieved with and for the people! Asymmetry: every player starts the game with different resources (energy, coins, keen combat sense, popularity…), a different starting location and a secret objective. The starting positions are specifically set to contribute to the uniqueness of every faction and the asymmetrical nature of the game. Strategy: Scythe offers players almost complete control over their fate. The only elements of chance apart from each player's individual secrete objective card are the Encounter cards, which players draw to interact with the citizens of newly explored lands. Combat is also handled by way of choice; no luck or chance is involved. Engine Building: Players can improve their construction abilities to become more efficient, build structures that improve their position on the map, enlist new recruits into their faction, activate mechs to dissuade opponents from invading and expand their borders to reap greater types and quantities of resources. This aspect creates a feeling of energy and progression over the course of the entire game. The order in which players get to develop their economy and technologies adds to the unique feel of every game, even when playing as the same faction several times.","['Board Game', 'Strategy', 'Turn-Based', 'Multiplayer', '4X', 'Tabletop', 'Alternate History', 'Mechs', 'Hex Grid', 'Turn-Based Strategy', 'Sci-fi', 'Steampunk', 'World War I', 'Singleplayer', 'Historical', 'Character Customization', 'Hand-drawn', 'Tactical', 'PvP', 'War']","['OS *: Windows 7 / Windows 8 / Windows 10', 'Processor: Dual Core 3.0 GHz', 'Memory: 4 GB RAM', 'Graphics: DirectX 11 class GPU with 1024MB VRAM', 'DirectX: Version 11', 'Storage: 2 GB available space']",['OS *: Windows 7 / Windows 8 / Windows 10'],"5 Sep, 2018",['The Knights of Unity'],['The Knights of Unity'],Very Positive,"(2,900)","2,467",https://store.steampowered.com/app/718560/Scythe_Digital_Edition?snr=1_category_4_strategy_100727

Maybe not even a game, but rather a digital toy. It was created by a single developer (hi that’s me, Paul) to scratch a very specific itch. The Ramp captures the unparalleled feeling of real life vert skateboarding and that’s pretty much it. There is a lot this game doesn’t feature.

Immerse yourself in the most complete motorcycle simulator ever! The unique simulator that allows you to ride countless types of vehicles, from quads to tree-wheelers, MX sidecars to dirtbikes, superbikes to pitbikes via Ohvale and Polini scooters! Directly From Motorcycle Physics and Dynamics Text BooksThe roots of TDR have been intertwined from the very beginning with the most important academic papers regarding motorcycle dynamics (eg. V. Cossalter). We worked really hard to understand the physics regarding motorcycles to be able to replicate it as accurately as possible in this project. This is not pulled out of the air: everything is validated by industrial simulation formulas, such as Magic Formula by Pacjecka, which we used as foundation to create our tire physical model. Our intention was to build a game that could give an experience as faithful to real life as it can be.Realism but with fun!We are fully committed to creating a game that could offer the maximum realism available, but that could also be enjoyed with a simple Joypad and without frustration. TDR surely isn’t an Arcade game, which means that you will make some mistakes. A late braking, a wobble, an unwanted wheelie, one too much skid will ruin your lap. Thanks to a learning curve within anyone’s’ reach, the more you will race the more you will learn your limits and become a better rider with each lap. We surely want TDR to be the peak of the simulative experience, but also something to have lots of fun with!Tire dynamics wearTires have a dynamic wear, that are physically simulated through the patch of contact of the rubber on the asphalt. Through the track conditions and your riding style you can determine the tire performance.High quality tracks an bikes modelsOur all tracks are reproductions of real circuits, made with the closest fidelity and high visual impact, thanks to the High Definition Render Pipeline. Even our bikes are reproductions of real motorcycles, made taking into account all the real sizes: tires, suspensions, forks, steer, wheelbase, all data are all faithfully reported in the simulation.Not only big wheelsIn TDR we don’t want to only simulate standard bikes, but we love to explore other growing branches, such as the one of the small wheels. We have been supported by a leading brand in the field such as Ohvale, which makes us feel extremely lucky. The Gp-0 is nowadays used as an official motorcycle to train a lot of professional riders, and we are happy to have it in official capacity in our game toghether with important brands like Polini, who made the fastest track racing scooter and YCF, one of the most important company that produce pitbikes. The small wheels will allow us to move the challenge to kart tracks and therefore open a whole new prospective over motorcycle simulation.","['Motocross', 'Bikes', 'Racing', 'Simulation', 'Motorbike', 'ATV', 'Sports', 'Driving', 'Realistic', 'PvP', '3D', 'Early Access', 'Indie', 'Singleplayer', 'Massively Multiplayer', 'Multiplayer', 'Automobile Sim', 'Runner', 'Offroad', 'First-Person']","['Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system', 'OS: Windows 10 64-bit Service Pack 1', 'Processor: Intel Core i5-4460 or AMD FX-8120', 'Memory: 8192 MB RAM', 'Graphics: Nvidia GTX 770, Radeon HD 7970', 'DirectX: Version 11', 'Network: Broadband Internet connection', 'Storage: 20 GB available space']","['Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system', 'OS: Windows 11 64-bit', 'Processor: Intel Core i5-8600K or AMD Ryzen 5 2600X', 'Memory: 16384 MB RAM', 'Graphics: GeForce GTX 1070 8 GB, Radeon RX 580 8GB', 'DirectX: Version 11', 'Network: Broadband Internet connection', 'Storage: 20 GB available space']","17 Mar, 2021",['MadCow S.r.l.'],['MadCow S.r.l.'],Very Positive,(649),319,https://store.steampowered.com/app/1511630/TrackDayR?snr=1_category_4_sportsandracing_100727

Session: Skate Sim,"Made by and for skaters, the dual stick controls faithfully reproduce your feet on the skateboard for an ultra-realistic experience. Try out real-life iconic skate spots, customise your skater and equipment with items from the top brands","About This Game
With the dual stick controls, each stick represents one of your feet. You will need to learn how to control them and transfer weight, just like on a real skateboard. The physics have been developed with a focus on realism, smoothness and immersion. Just like in real life for a new skateboarder, the first hours can seem challenging, but once you have mastered the technique, you will feel the unrivalled thrill of pulling off your very first kickflip! Session: Skate Sim also includes full options customisation, so you can enjoy the perfect experience tailored to you. A full tutorial provides all the help you need to get started, and you can choose from four difficulty levels! Inspired by the golden age of street skating – the 1990s – Session: Skate Sim lets you experience true skateboarding and its culture: no scoring system; just you, your spot and your imagination! There's no need for judges to tell you that your noseslide or varial heelflip are perfect for this spot. And because certain locations are iconic, the developers have added several of them to the game for you to skate in and express your creativity, including Black Hubbas (New York City), Brooklyn banks (New York City), FDR Park (Philadelphia) and many other spots.Skating and pulling off the best lines in the best spots is one thing, but if no one is there to film it, it didn't really happen… In Session: Skate Sim, you can film with a 1990s filter or fisheye lens, and you can use the video editor to create your clips and share them. You can play with multiple options, including changing the field of view, time of day, filters, and different camera views (tripod, orbit, etc.). Session: Skate Sim also offers the chance to go from skater to filmmaker: pull off your moves then go into film mode to experience the action from the point of view of your camera operator and create the best clip.Show off your style with an extensive customisation system for your skater and skateboard. By completing challenges, you earn money to spend in skate shops. You can find nearly 200 items (hoodies, shoes, caps, T-shirts, trousers, etc.) from top brands, such as Fallen, Zero, GrindKing, Thankyou, HIJINX Net, Antilanta, Roger Skate CO, No-Comply, iDabble and others. You can also customise your skateboard with over 250 parts, such as wheels, trucks and many other components from famous brands like, No-Comply, GindKing, Thankyou and many others. In addition to the design aspect, the components (trucks, riser pads, wheels…) impact the way you skate. Find the right ones for your style and shred the most iconic spots!","['Sports', 'Skateboarding', 'Simulation', 'Singleplayer', 'Indie', 'Action', 'Realistic', 'Third Person', 'Difficult', 'Exploration', 'Funny', 'Family Friendly', 'Physics', 'Early Access', 'Character Customization', 'Skating', 'Immersive Sim', 'Parkour', 'Multiplayer', 'Strategy']","['OS *: Windows 7', 'Processor: Intel Core i7-2700K or AMD FX-8370', 'Memory: 8 GB RAM', 'Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 650 Ti, 2 GB or AMD Radeon R7 360, 2 GB', 'DirectX: Version 9.0', 'Storage: 15 GB available space', 'Sound Card: On board', ""Additional Notes: Your experience with Session will be best at higher FPS.

							PIPE is a physics based BMX experience built for the BMX community designed to simulate realistic BMX motion. Perform over 50 aerial stunts, grind any corner, send big airs in the PIPE! PIPE also includes some fun Easter Eggs for those willing to explore and think outside the box. 

Mash Games has been in the works of developing the all around EPIC console game BMX Streets. 
Mash Games chose to stay away from options such as crowd sourcing, and has been actively engaging 
followers through physics demo releases and the BMX Streets mobile game. Myself along with the small
 Mash Games team, have been working incredibly hard to define and develop the future of BMX (and other extreme sports) 
video game physics, from an independent level. The community has shown tremendous support through these projects, and 
it's now that I would like to introduce you to....BMX Streets: PIPE.

So please, enjoy some delicious vert ramp boosting and lets SEND IT!
